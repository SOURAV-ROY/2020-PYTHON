In the following scene, Macbeth and Banquo discuss the weather and their victory.
As they wander onto a heath, the Three Witches enter and greet them with prophecies.
Though Banquo challenges them first, they address Macbeth, hailing him as "Thane of
Glamis," "Thane of Cawdor," and that he will "be King hereafter." Macbeth appears to be
stunned to silence. When Banquo asks of his own fortunes, the witches respond paradoxically,
 saying that he will be less than Macbeth, yet happier, less successful, yet more. He will
 father a line of kings, though he himself will not be one. While the two men wonder at these
  pronouncements, the witches vanish, and another thane, Ross, arrives and informs Macbeth of
   his newly bestowed title: Thane of Cawdor. The first prophecy is thus fulfilled, and Macbeth,
   previously sceptical, immediately begins to harbour ambitions of becoming king
